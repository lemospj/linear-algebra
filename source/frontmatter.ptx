      These are partially written lecture notes for an introductory course to linear algebra. I will be updating this website very frequently in order to ensure that the notes remain up to date with the content being introduced in the linear algebra course I am currently teaching at Temple University. It is very likely that mistakes and typos will be introduced in these notes from time to time. If you spot one, please contact me!
