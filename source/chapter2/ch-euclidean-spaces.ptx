  <title>Euclidean spaces</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces. Very roughly, these are sets where addition and scalar multiplication is possible. We will see a formal definition later in the course. In this chapter, we will focus on the the prototypical (finite-dimensional) vector space over the real numbers: that is <m>\R^n</m>.
