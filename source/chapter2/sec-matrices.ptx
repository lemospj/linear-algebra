    <title>Matrices</title>
    <p>
        We already discussed matrices briefly when we studied the Gauss--Jordan elimination algorithm. In that setting, the main purpose of assigning a matrix to a linear system was to simplify notation and clarify the operations required to transform the given system into one in reduced row echelon form. However, matrices play a much more important role in linear algebra. As we will soon see, an <m>m\times n</m> matrix encodes the information required to describe a particular kind of function from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m>: a <em>linear map</em>. But before we speak about linear maps, we need to discuss matrix addition and multiplication.

        If the number of rows of a matrix <m>A</m> is the same as the number of rows of a matrix <m>B</m>, and if the same is true of the number of columns, then it is possible to define the sum <m>A+B</m> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. This sum will also be a matrix with the same number of rows of <m>A</m> (and of <m>B</m>) and the same number of columns of <m>A</m> (and of <m>B</m>). Let's see the formal description of matrix addition.

                Let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be two positive integers, and let <m>A=(a_{ij})_{ij}</m> and <m>B=(b_{ij})_{ij}</m> be two <m>m\times n</m> matrices. Recall that this short-hand notation means that the entry in row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m> of matrix <m>A</m> is <m>a_{ij}</m>, and the entry in row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m> of matrix <m>B</m> is <m>b_{ij}</m>. The matrix <m>A+B</m> is the <m>m\times n</m> matrix whose <m>(i,j)</m> entry is given by <m>a_{ij}+b_{ij}</m>. Visually,

            Vectors of <m>\R^n</m> are a special kind of matrix. Indeed, they can be regarded as <m>n\times 1</m> matrices, i.e. matrices with <m>n</m> rows and a single column. Under this interpretation, matrix addition and vector addition are compatible.
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
        We will denote the set of <m>m\times n</m> matrices by <m>\Mat_{m\times n}</m>. So, <m>A\in\Mat_{m\times n}</m> means that <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
        If <m>A=(a_{ij})_{ij}</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, then we define <m>-A</m> to be the matrix <m>(-a_{ij})_{ij}</m>. It is easy to check (you should do it!) that <m>A+(-A)=0</m>, the zero matrix.

        It is also possible to multiply matrices by a scalar.

            <p>
                If <m>\lambda\in \R</m> is a scalar and <m>A=(a_{ij})_{ij}</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, the matrix <m>\lambda A</m> is defined to be the matrix <m>(\lambda a_{ij})_{ij}</m>. In other words, it is the <m>m\times n</m> matrix obtained from <m>A</m> by multiplying each entry by <m>\lambda</m>.

        You should check that, as in the case of vectors, we have the equality <m>(-1)\cdot A=-A</m>.
